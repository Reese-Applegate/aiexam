The reading passage and the lecture are both about the claim that Robert E. Peary have reached the North Pole as according to himself. Th author believes that the claim has reliability. In contrast, the lecturer opposes the specific points made in the reading.

First of all, the author of the passage claims that a commitee that the National Geographic Socity put together conducted Peary's records and equipment. However, the lecture counters such claim. The committee actually declared such approvememt. In fact, the committee are regarded as subject organization. After the approvemet, it has been found that there is close friends of Peary in the committee, and large money was invested by Peary. Moreover, the committee companies only for two days. So, this claim has no credibility.

Second, the author of the passage states that a British explorer named Tom Avery verified the possibility of the journey, especially in the view of velocity. On the other hand, the lecturer disagrees with such statement. As a matter of fact, the circumstances was different indeed. The lecturer points out the two points. One, even if they used same slide system, but they had variety of their containers. Avery used airplain to move food supplies instead of including in the slide system like Peary does. Second, the climate was different. When the Avery's journey was performed, the weather suits for the expedition. On the other hand, it was unfavorable for Peary's case.

Finally, the author of the article mentions that there are photographs that support his claim. Nevertheless, the lecturer challenges such mention. As according to the lecturer, measuring the shadows needs high accuracy. But, the photographs might be damaged because it has been hundreds years ago. In other words, the photographs might be faded, or worned possibly. As a conclusion, the photographs cannot provide information to calculate the position of the sun precisely.
