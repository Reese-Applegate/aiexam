Hello,
How are you?
I am fine. And you?
I am also fine.
I am learning Django.
What about you?
I am learning Python.
Oh, that's great.
Thank you.
I am learning Django.
You already said that.
No, I said I am learning Python.
Oh, I see.
No, you didn't see that.
What do you mean?
I mean you didn't see that.
I don't get it.
You wouldn't get it.


Arther Fleck : Murray, one small thing.
Murray Franklin : Yeah?
Arther Fleck : When you bring me out, can you introduce me as Joker?
Arther Fleck : You are awful.
Murray Franklin : I am awful?
Arther Fleck : Yes, you are awful.
Murray Franklin : Why do you say that?
Arther Fleck : Playing my video, inviting me to your show, and you just want to making fun of me.
Arther Fleck : How about another joke?
Murray Franklin : No, I think we are done here.
Arther Fleck : What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?
Murray Franklin : Call the police, Gene.
Arther Fleck : I'll tell you what you get! YOU GET WHAT YOU FUCKING DESERVE!
[Arther shoots Murray in the head]
Arther Fleck : [to the camera] Goodnight, and always remember: that's life.

Doctor : What's so funny?
Arther Fleck : Just thinking of a joke.
Doctor : Do you want to tell it to me?
Arther Fleck : You wouldn't get it.
